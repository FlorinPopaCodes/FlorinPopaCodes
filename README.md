### Hi there, fellow traveller! 👋

### If you're a developer, you might be interested in the following:

- ✨ My longly curated GitHub Stars collection: [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/FlorinPopaCodes?tab=stars)
    - You might find a few gems in there.
- 🪐 [AstroBuildAction](https://github.com/FlorinPopaCodes/AstroBuildAction) is a which checks runs a Github action to check if the stars are aligned, in which case it fails. This prevents a lot of tears and late nights when deploying when the stars don't allow it.


### If you struggle with productivity:
- 🧘 You could try a free month of the meditation app [Waking UP](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SCF6B29F6)
    - Try to get to at least 60 minutes of meditation per day. It's a game changer.
    - Mix and match the different types of meditation to find what works best for you.
- 📚 If you need more structure in your day, try a free month of [Focusmate Plus](https://www.focusmate.com/?fmreferral=DRz3p70h5F) (and I also get one for free).
    - There's a [Focusmate Software Developers Group](https://www.focusmate.com/signup/softwaredevelopers) that you can join to pair with other developers.
    - Here's my [Focusmate Profile](https://www.focusmate.com/user/florin-popa-codes) if you want to pair with me sometimes.


### If you're a recruiter:
- 🦾 I created the ["Acts as a Friend" prompt](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/pull/508) in [f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts?tab=readme-ov-file#act-as-a-friend) by fine-tunning an OpenAI DaVinci model.
